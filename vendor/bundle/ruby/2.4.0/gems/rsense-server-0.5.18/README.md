RSense is a tool for doing static analysis of Ruby source code. Rsense is used in conjunction with an editor plugin.

RSense is currently under heavy development and not ready to use yet.  It would be awesome if you helped get things done.

## Credits

Rsense was originally designed and implemented by [Matsuyama Tomohiro(@m2ym)](https://github.com/m2ym/), and his hard work is still at the core of rsense today.  All of the algorithms for type-detection were implemented by him, with inspiration from multiple places.  You can read about his original version at [Rsense: A Ruby Development tools for Emacs, Vim and Others](http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/)

In 2013, a major undertaking by @edubkendo to bring it current and improve its usefullness to rubyists was sponsored by the @jruby organization as a Google Summer of Code project.

Special thanks belongs to [Tom Enebo (@enebo)](https://github.com/enebo) who provided excellent mentorship, code, architectural suggestions and more throughout the course of the update.
